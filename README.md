# Body Condition Data Management

The Datasheets folder contains datasheets for individual field efforts. 

R code for processing data are stored in the root of the folder. Code numbered 0+ are intended to be run in order as the data are available for processing. Code numbered 99 are stored for longetivity, but are intended to only be run once to address a specific issue or run as needed, depending on the intent of the code.

The code (as of 9/9/2023) is as follows:
* BodyCondition_00_RenameImages.R - code to rename images collected by the M2EA drone
* BodyCondition_00_RenameImages_M30T.R - code to rename images collected by the M30T drone; currently in development and on-hold until we decide how we will move forward with handling and processing those images
*
